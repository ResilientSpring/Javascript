<p>A new thing for you to learn about functions is that they can
    have other functions nested inside them.</p>

<script>
var myname = "John";

function say_name() {
    var mydog = "Joey";

    function say_food() {
        var myfood = "Pizza";
        window.alert(myname + " and " + mydog + " like " + myfood);
    }

    window.alert(myname + " has a dog named " + mydog);
    say_food();
}

say_name();

</script>
