<p>A new thing for you to learn about functions is that they can
  have other functions nested inside them.</p>

<script>
  var myname = "John";

  function say_name() {
    var mydog = "Joey";

    // The say_food() function can only be called within the say_name() function and is not available
    // in the global context. It can use any variables from the say_name() context or the global
    // context.
    function say_food() {
      var myfood = "Pizza";
      window.alert(myname + " and " + mydog + " like " + myfood);
    }

    window.alert(myname + " has a dog named " + mydog);
    say_food();
  }

  // Call the say_name() function, which calls the say_food() function within it.
  // The say_name() function can be called from the global context, but has a local variable mydog
  // and a local function say_food().
  say_name();
